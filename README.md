# Beat.Box
> Our team is building a multimedia platform for music, internet radio, and podcasts so listeners everywhere can save time by streamlining their experience. Beat.Box will allow users to stream music, play their own downloaded music files, tune into globally-synced internet radio channels, and listen to their favorite podcasts all with the same app. 

> By Libin Koyikalathu, Naomi Padilla, Austin Sansing, Nelson Uzoaru, and Avery VanAusdal

## General Information
![Logo](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-s22-romulans/beat.box/downloads/Beat.Box.png)

Dedicated servers for streaming and licenses with major publishers are a bit expensive for a student project, so we'll be working with what we've got.
