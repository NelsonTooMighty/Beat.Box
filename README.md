## General Information
![Logo](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-s22-romulans/beat.box/downloads/Beat.Box.png)

Dedicated servers for streaming and licenses with major publishers are a bit expensive for a student project, so we'll be working with what we've got.

## Sprint 1:
### Naomi Rae:

  - Worked on References:
      - https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-s22-romulans/beat.box/src/master/src/main/LayoutFrame.java
      - https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-s22-romulans/beat.box/src/master/src/main/Player.java
  - Acknowledgements:
      - Designing the the basic music player I followed BRO CODE on youtube
        - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyZQVJiARTQ
      - Learning about netbean and how to create a basic functional GUI I took guidance from Mahmoud Hamwi
        - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg5zWJTQWx8&t=229s
      -
  - Summary of Work Done:
      - Did research and had created a basic functional GUI on netbean. I got the buttons to lead to other GUI that we plan on creating in the next sprint are the artist and song page.
      - Created a basic Music Player gui with functional play, restart and pause button. This GUI reads a wav file and plays this file as a clip. I tried to connect both functional GUIS but each GUI was made on a different platforms so it was difficult to combine the two.
