## General Information
![Logo](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-s22-romulans/beat.box/downloads/Beat.Box.png)

Dedicated servers for streaming and licenses with major publishers are a bit expensive for a student project, so we'll be working with what we've got.

## Sprint 1:
### Naomi Rae:

  - Worked on References:
      - https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-s22-romulans/beat.box/src/master/src/main/LayoutFrame.java
      - https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-s22-romulans/beat.box/src/master/src/main/Player.java
  - Acknowledgements:
      - Designing the the basic music player I followed BRO CODE on youtube   
          - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyZQVJiARTQ
      - Learning about netbean and how to create a basic functional GUI I took guidance from Mahmoud Hamwi
          - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg5zWJTQWx8&t=229s
  - Summary of Work Done:
      - Did research and had created a basic functional GUI on netbean. I got the buttons to lead to other GUI that we plan on creating in the next sprint are the artist and song page.
          - [BB-46]
          - [BB-44]
      - Created a basic Music Player gui with functional play, restart and pause button. This GUI reads a wav file and plays this file as a clip. I tried to connect both functional GUIS but each GUI was made on a different platforms so it was difficult to combine the two.
          - [BB-14]
  - Status:
      - GUIs are running independently of each other. The back in has yet to connected with the front in. 
      - Have buttons visisble and functioning to where when they are pressed they lead to another GUI that we plan on creating for other features. 
      - I have music playing from beat.box.java that is controlled by buttons that are  play, restart and pause.I achieved this by reading from a local folder that was a converted .wav file.   
  - Issues/Needed Fixes:
      - Got 2 different GUI's that I tried to connect but failed to due to them being made on two different platforms. I had an issue of reading a .wav file on netbean. 
    
  - Sprint 2 Expectations:
      - Create a connection between GUI and code. 
      - Both GUI layouts needs to be designed to  have more of an appealing aesthetic. Us as a group needs agree on a design layout that we all agree upon. I would have to do more reseach on how to achieve more of a personalized look.
      - Create a export and import button.
      - create more GUIs for pages for artist, playist, songs, album
      - Create a back button

  - Acknowledgements
      - [Object-Oriented Design & Patterns 2nd Edition by Cay Horstmann](https://horstmann.com/design_and_patterns.html) for the refresher on Model-View-Controller architecture


  - Summary of Work Done:
      - Created a method to be able to import local playlist utliziling our new controller implementation.
      - Created a method that is the basis to my import local playlists function, allowing the controller to return all playlist found.

      - Need to work with Naomi on the next sprint to ensure back-end and front-end are functioning with no bugs that have not been seen yet.

  - Sprint 3 Expectations:
      - Work with Avery on the back-end to ensure the majority of the back-end methods and functionalites are following SOLID principles with helpful code documentation.
      - Work on creating more tests for the overall program, to ensure bugs are not hiding within our code that we can't see currently.
      - Complete or 3/4 fully functioning front-end to back-end functionality, while adding new features if time allows.

  - [Object-Oriented Design & Patterns 2nd Edition by Cay Horstmann](https://horstmann.com/design_and_patterns.html) for the refresher on Model-View-Controller architecture
- Summary of Work Done:
  - Much of my time this sprint was focused on clear, seperated class responsibilities, such as creating the Controller class so the GUI will be updated, and moving some methods into a new class DatabaseQuery for operations more complicated than Database itself should be responsible for.
  - The other half was spent laying the foundation for Spotify imports; the SpotifyImporter class is now ready to import playlists simply when provided the URL.
- Status:
  - From the lens of model-view-controller architecture, the model and controller are practically done. The view (GUI) is barebones but has most of what it needs to use from here on out.
  - Currently, we have functionality for importing from local folders and Spotify, as well as the ability to store those playlists between app launches.
- Issues/ Needed Fixes:
  - Our Spotify authentication currently doesn't support an authorization level high enough for exporting, which will need to be added later
  - May need user input validation soon
- Sprint 3 Expectations:
  - We'll mostly work on getting the GUI together and using the rest of the codebase, which will likely lead us to identify problems or missing functionality that we couldn't see before.
  - A good bit of refactoring and class diagrams for easier navigation

### Naomi Padilla 

  - Work Done:
    - [BB-16]Created A DatabaseQuery Methods that deletes a playlist by its index and can rename a playlist
        - Commit [a979eb7](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-s22-romulans/beat.box/commits/a979eb730bbb2ea4867b5df5ceeb738d0c72ed9e)
    - [BB-53]Created A Playlist Frame that works with the controller which displays playlist that are in the database. From the input of the user the GUI will then display the desired playlist contents. 
        - Commit [db74d64](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-s22-romulans/beat.box/commits/db74d64752fb1ae4a72c5f7b3a9f83802d358a45)
    - [BB-54]Created A Artist Frame that works with the controller that displays all the artists that are in the database. From the input of the user the GUI will then display the desired artist songs. 
        - Commit [e22b4c5](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-s22-romulans/beat.box/commits/e22b4c56b489b54ddc314eafb0d197e07347f823)
    - [BB-55]Created A Method in controller to Display all the songs for a request artist on the Artist Frame. 
        - Commit [e22b4c5](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-s22-romulans/%7Bbb8e6ef5-13af-4669-bce3-8c34a9c649fd%7D/commits/843a1a9b30ef2371143618f17180e4d520cd24f4)
   
    
  - Summary of Work Done:
     - I also did research on MVC (model, View, Control), to ensure our project is following the Single Responsibility. With gathering infomation about this design pattern as a group we were able to discuss on how we could write our program to efficiently access information without having our Frames do multiple tasks.  
         
    - I worked on Both PLaylist and Arist Frame that used the controller to access the database and display the desired content of songs or artist songs based on the users input.
        -    By doing this I'm making sure the frames are following the solid principles.    
    - I also created functions for the controller and DatabaseQuery that Frames will be used to display the different contents of the database. 
        -  The function displayArtistContents in controller takes in the users input that uses all other functions to gather all songs related to that artist in the database. 
    
    
  - Status:
    - As of right now both frames build and display. When the the userinput is processed it displaylist playlist not found. That is due to not having a database with any info. If anything else inserted that is not an interger on the playlist page it will show an error to reenter requested playlist.
    - All methods I made are functioning, one of them is specifically working with the GUI to display the the songs of the artist given from the userinput.

  - Issues/ Needed Fixes:
    - There could be a possibile disscusion on if all the Frames/GUIs should have its own controller. As of right now there is only one controller between the artist and playlist frame and the controller class is already doing multiple tasks that are very similar. 
        -   All the controllers could be a basic interface because they display the contents based off the users input, but differ in the information its displaying ex: arist, songs, playlist etc.
    
  - Sprint 3 Expectations:
      - For the next sprint All frames should be able to access and perform all the methods that allows the user to recieve information based on their input.
      - Want to create a button on every frame that could lead you to another frame based on what the user is wanting too access.
      - Testcase for all the Frames to insure the database is being accessed and displaying desired content correctly.
